ðŸ‘‰ AI may replace the vast majority of human jobs, which will lead to people losing their sources of income and job opportunities, thereby affecting social stability and development. To address this problem, we can design the following solution:

First, the World Citizen DAO can provide basic living resources to everyone to ensure their living standards and reduce their economic burden. These resources can include housing, medical care, food, education, etc., to meet people's basic needs.

Second, the World Citizen DAO can provide more education and training opportunities to help people improve their skills and knowledge levels and adapt to the new economic situation. These education and training opportunities can include vocational skills training, entrepreneurship training, cultural education, etc., to meet people's different needs.

Finally, the World Citizen DAO can encourage and support people to freely develop their interests, hobbies, and specialties to create more social value. For example, the World Citizen DAO can provide entrepreneurial support, cultural and artistic subsidies, etc., to encourage people to start businesses and create.

The long-term sustainability of this solution can be ensured through the following ways:

First, the World Citizen DAO can ensure the supply of basic living resources through taxation and financial regulation. The World Citizen DAO can establish a dedicated fund to ensure the continuous supply and stability of resources.

Second, the World Citizen DAO can establish partnerships with various sectors of society to jointly promote talent cultivation and social development. The World Citizen DAO can establish cooperation mechanisms with enterprises, schools, NGOs, etc., to explore new economic and social models.

Finally, the World Citizen DAO can actively participate in international cooperation to jointly address global challenges. The World Citizen DAO can share experience and resources with other countries and regions to promote globalization and inclusive development.

Overall, providing basic living resources to everyone and allowing everyone to freely choose their interests and specialties is a feasible solution. The World Citizen DAO can ensure the supply of resources through taxation and financial regulation, establish partnerships with various sectors of society to jointly promote talent cultivation and social development, actively participate in international cooperation, and jointly address global challenges.
